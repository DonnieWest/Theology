<h2>About Donnie</h2>

I was born and raised in Kansas City, MO. I come from a free-will baptist background with hints of pietism here and there. I attend a house church where I worship God alongside my wife and our 5 children. Here you can find my musing on various theological issues. Please keep in mind: Christ is permanent and perfect while my writings are not.
