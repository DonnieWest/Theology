This blog is merely the outward expression of my thoughts on various theological ideas - a personal systematic theology if you will. As I am a sinful man, they will change over time. In spite of this, scripture and God remain the same. Today. Forever. Always.

Deuteronomy 12:1

Feel free to reprove me if I am in error.

I hope that it will be profitable for others who are also thinking through these same issues.
