All of us live in a world deluded by it's own grandeur. It seems like any problem can be solved through human ingenuity or at least a temporary peace be wrought through the forgetting of differences. Besides, even if God were to exist, He is a good God, right? It's easy then when presented with the idea of being "saved" that our generation asks "Saved from what?"

## 1. What am I being saved from?

From God.

God is the creator of the Universe. He is Almighty, Everlasting, the essence of Life, Righteous, and Just. That's exactly the problem you are faced with: 

>God is good and you are not.

[God spoke and the world came into existence](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201&version=ESV). At His command the stars fell into alignment, the oceans stayed at their boundaries. At God's word, all existence bowed and simply *did*. This all powerful God walked upon His creation and specially created man for fellowship and to worship God in a way nothing else could. Man was created to be like God. To man God gave [one command](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:15-17&version=ESV). Man told God [no](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:6&version=ESV). 

Sin is the term that wraps up our resistance to God's purpose for us, our disobedience and our falling short of God's standard. Sin also is our public rejection of God and His gifts of Goodness, Justice, and Life from our world. This is why we have pain, hunger, suffering and ultimately death. Before man rebelled, God told man that on the day he disobeyed he would ["...surely die."](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:17&version=ESV).

Beyond the rejection of God's gifts, sin also makes us deserving of God's wrath, represented in the Bible [as a cup](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+25:15&version=ESV). Since God is good, He must hate evil. Since God is infinitely Worthy and Good, our punishment must be equivalent when we rebel against Him. Therefore, we are punished by being forced to drink the cup of God's wrath in Hell for all eternity.

Despite God's statement that the first man would die the day he sinned, he didn't. He was expelled from God's presence, a spiritual death, but was given a promise. God would put an end to this sin and death through "the offspring of the woman." In another place, God is describing Himself as ["...merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty..."](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus%2034:6-7&version=ESV).

But if God cannot "clear the guilty" then how can he forgive "iniquity and transgression and sin"? For that matter, why the man didn't die physically and immediately?

## 2. How then am I saved?

Since all mankind was condemned and [no one upheld God's law](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3:10&version=ESV), God Himself came down to save us and He was called [Jesus](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8:58&version=ESV). He was born to a virgin, as ["the offspring of the woman"](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3:19&version=ESV), put aside all of [His godhood](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:6&version=ESV) and lived a sinless life. He [experienced all of our conflicts and pain yet remained faithful](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:15&version=ESV) to the purpose God set forth for all of mankind. If you were to put the entire universe on a scale and put Jesus on the other end, His worth would outweigh everything and everyone.

He also died our death. Jesus was made a [propitiation](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+2:17&version=ESV) for our sins: this means Jesus was placarded in the middle of the world where He took on all of our sins and debts and drank the [cup of the wrath of God](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26:39&version=ESV). Since this sacrifice was sufficient, Jesus was raised again three days after His death. He gave further proof to His accomplishment by showing Himself to many people before returning to heaven.

This sacrifice was sufficient for everyone, however, it is only effective to those who fit a very specific requirement.  We must [believe and trust in His sacrifice, that He was crucified, buried, and rose again](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:1-11&version=ESV). This is why the first man did not die that day. God passed over the sins of His people down through the ages because He did not "clear the guilty." Sin was punished and God could also forgive our sin as a result.

Jesus Christ's sacrifice fixed our relationship with God, yet it comes with additional benefits. Those who have accepted the sacrifice of Christ also are imbued with the Spirit of God [who makes us more like God](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15:16&version=ESV). In this way, the requirements God placed upon mankind are no longer a list of things to avoid but rather of list of things we want to do freely because we have become more like God. The Holy Spirit also seals us, making us incapable of [falling out of salvation](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1:13&version=ESV). The evidence of this salvation is that we [work to do good](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2:14&version=ESV) in the world around us.

Some of that work includes [helping the poor, the suffering and the hurting](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025:31-40&version=ESV). We are called to [spread this Good News](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28:19&version=ESV), or Gospel, to others. We are also instructed to [read the Bible](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+1:3&version=ESV), God's word, as well as [gather together in groups of believers](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:25&version=ESV) known as a church.

This is the lens through which a Christian must also view the entire rest of the Bible as well as base their interpretation upon - as one who was an enemy of God and is saved by the sacrifice of Christ. It is also how we are to view our world, not as something to be fixed by the hands of man but restored by the word of God.
